# Use Opinionated Abstractions to Launch Quickly

Have you ever ordered a sandwich from a restaurant where the conversation goes something like this?

You: "I'll have the Club, please."

Server: 
- Would you like the 6" or 12" size?
- White or wheat bread?
- Cheddar, Swiss, or American cheese?
- Mayo, Oil, or Honey Mustard?
- Lettuce?
- Tomato?
- Pickles?
- Onions?
- Do you want it toasted?
- Do you want it sliced?
- Will you eat here or to-go?

Alternatively, if the menu were designed with Opinionated Abstractions, the Club could have default settings:

Club: 6" White Bread with Chedder Cheese, Mayo, Lettuce, Tomato, Pickles, Onions, Toasted and Sliced Ready To-Go

That's not to say that you couldn't order variations like: "Club with American Cheese" or "12-inch Club with Honey Mustard and no Onions"

But you have the default option of getting your order placed and on your way much faster.

The same is true with landing pages.  Of course, you could it from scratch to tweak and customize every little detail.  
But it also gives you the ability to simply come up with an idea, and leverage smart abstractions to launch it very quickly.
