# Have an idea? Launch it now!

Have you ever had an idea that you never acted on?  And then months or years later you saw that someone else launched it to great success? 

Don't ever let that happen again.  When you have an idea, act immediately, and launch it with an instant landing page.

All you have to do is [click here](https://github.com/nathanclevenger/minimal-landing-page/generate) and create your landing page in seconds.

If you've got a domain name already, that's great, you can use it for free with GitHub pages.  

But if you don't have a domain, this template will automatically generate one for you for free with [Builder.Domains](https://builder.domains).
